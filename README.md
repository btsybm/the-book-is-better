# The Book Is Better
## Objective:
### I have always been an avid book reader and movie/tv consumer so I love comparing a book to it's adaptation.  As most people have experienced, one is usually drastically better than the other.  The intent of my app is to create a resource for people to chime in on which they prefer or to help someone decide whether a book or movie is worth spending their time on.
